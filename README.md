Test menu items for teachaway website

I have used Action class to test the menu item for teachaway website. As menu opens with mouse over, Action class in selenim 
provides way to complex user gestures like mouse over, double click etc.

I have verified that each menu item should be enabled or get displayed on UI. If any menu item is not enabled or displayed error will be displayed and
Assertion will be failed. This will indicate that UI is not working as expected and test will stop.



For Future use- I have added this project as TDD, and created the page object classes.This framework will run as TestNG. 
All locator will be defined in one place. We can create one signle methods where different xpath will passed which will avaid the duplication of code.
And will help to manintain and read the code easily.
